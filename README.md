Blackjack written in JS to be played on a browser. 
To play, run /static/blackjack.html in Firefox or Chrome (IE currently untested).
Should also be available at havvy.net:8080/blackjack.

Currently only text-based. No split functionality implemented. Single player only.

TODO (possibly):

Add graphics.
Implement hand splitting.
